# The WoodenBeaver sound theme

![Wooden](/banner.png)

The WoodenBeaver sound theme is a proposal for new default system sounds for Ubuntu 18.04. 
The intention was to create a cohesive set of sounds that will enhance the user experience without getting in the way.
The WoodenBeaver sounds are played on a wooden percussion instrument to give the theme an african feeling. 
To make the theme feel light and responsive, the sounds are short and there's no reverb or delay added.

Enjoy!
